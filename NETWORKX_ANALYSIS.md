# NetworkX Graph Analysis for SEO

This document explains the comprehensive NetworkX-based graph analysis suite for SEO optimization in the MCP Data4SEO server.

## Overview

The NetworkX analysis suite provides advanced graph algorithms to analyze website link structures beyond basic PageRank, offering multiple ways to organize and analyze nodes for strategic SEO decision-making.

## Available Tools

### 1. `analyze_centrality` - Authority and Hub Identification

**Purpose**: Identify authoritative pages and navigation hubs using multiple centrality measures.

**Parameters**:
- `domain`: Domain to analyze (requires existing link graph)
- `metrics`: List of centrality metrics to calculate (default: betweenness, closeness, eigenvector)
- `top_k`: Number of top pages to return per metric (default: 20)

**Centrality Measures**:
- **Betweenness Centrality**: Identifies bridge pages that connect different site sections
- **Closeness Centrality**: Finds pages that are easily accessible from other pages
- **Eigenvector Centrality**: Detects authoritative pages linked by other authoritative pages
- **Degree Centrality**: Basic link popularity (in-degree and out-degree)
- **Katz Centrality**: Alternative authority measure for directed graphs

**SEO Applications**:
- Identify pages with natural authority for strategic internal linking
- Find bridge pages that can connect different site sections
- Discover underutilized high-authority pages
- Optimize navigation structure around natural hubs

**Example Response**:
```json
{
  "domain": "https://example.com/",
  "analysis_type": "centrality",
  "metrics_analyzed": ["betweenness", "eigenvector"],
  "top_pages_by_metric": {
    "betweenness": [
      {
        "url": "https://example.com/about",
        "title": "About Us",
        "betweenness_centrality": 0.0234
      }
    ]
  },
  "seo_insights": [
    "ðŸŒ‰ Top bridge page: 'About Us' - Use this page to connect different site sections"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "priority": "high",

### 6. `comprehensive_graph_analysis` - Complete Analysis Suite

**Purpose**: Run all NetworkX analyses in one comprehensive report.

**Parameters**:
- `domain`: Domain to analyze

**Features**:
- Combines all analysis types
- Unified insights and recommendations
- Prioritized action items
- Overall site health assessment

**Health Assessment**:
- **Excellent** (80%+): Strong structure, good navigation, clear topics
- **Good** (60-80%): Solid foundation with improvement opportunities
- **Fair** (40-60%): Some structural issues, needs optimization
- **Poor** (<40%): Significant structural problems requiring attention

## Prerequisites

Before using NetworkX analysis tools, you must first:

1. **Build Link Graph**: Use `build_link_graph` or `analyze_pagerank` to create the internal link database
2. **Have Sufficient Data**: Minimum 10 pages with internal links for meaningful analysis
3. **Connected Structure**: Site should have some internal linking (not all orphaned pages)

## Workflow Integration

### Typical Analysis Workflow:

1. **Initial Setup**:
   ```
   build_link_graph -> analyze_pagerank
   ```

2. **Comprehensive Analysis**:
   ```
   comprehensive_graph_analysis
   ```

3. **Focused Analysis** (choose based on needs):
   ```
   analyze_centrality (for authority identification)
   detect_communities (for content strategy)
   analyze_navigation_paths (for UX optimization)
   find_connector_pages (for internal linking)
   analyze_site_structure (for architecture review)
   ```

### Use Cases by SEO Goal:

**Content Strategy**:
- `detect_communities` â†’ Identify topic clusters
- `analyze_centrality` â†’ Find content authorities
- `find_connector_pages` â†’ Connect content areas

**Technical SEO**:

## Performance Considerations

### Scalability:
- **Small sites** (< 100 pages): All algorithms run quickly
- **Medium sites** (100-1000 pages): Some algorithms use sampling for efficiency
- **Large sites** (1000+ pages): Automatic optimization and progress reporting

### Memory Usage:
- Graph construction: ~1MB per 1000 pages

- **Modularity 0.1-0.3**: Moderate clustering
- **Modularity < 0.1**: Weak community structure

### Path Efficiency:
- **Average path < 3**: Excellent navigation
- **Average path 3-4**: Good navigation
- **Average path > 4**: Navigation issues

### Structural Health:
- **Max k-core â‰¥ 3**: Strong structural foundation
